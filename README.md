# Multi-Precision-Adder-Design-for-FPGA
Course project of Complex Digital Design

Description:
This project aims to significantly enhance the performance of multi-precision adder circuits within an FPGA environment, targeting a critical reduction in the operational latency from the existing 34 clock cycles to 18 or fewer. The task involves designing a new, more efficient combinational adder circuit that supersedes the conventional ripple-carry adder used in the multi-precision (MP) adder module. By enabling a larger `ADDER_WIDTH` of 32 bits, the project seeks to optimize the calculation of 512-bit additions, thus ensuring the design adheres to the stringent timing constraints of 125 MHz and remains within the resource availability of the FPGA. The challenge extends to potentially increasing `ADDER_WIDTH` beyond 32 bits, aiming for even lower latency while maintaining positive worst negative slack (WNS) in post-synthesis timing reports. Additionally, as an optional enhancement, the project may explore extending the MP adder's functionality to include other arithmetic operations such as subtraction, comparison, and multiplication, leveraging the improved adder design. This endeavor not only focuses on pushing the boundaries of speed versus area trade-offs in FPGA-based adder circuits but also sets a foundation for advanced arithmetic module development in high-performance computing applications.
